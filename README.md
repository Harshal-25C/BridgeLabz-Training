### 📅 Week 2: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

---

### 🗓 Day 1 – OOPs Fundamentals (Class & Object), Eclipse IDE & Git Branching  
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**

Started learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts in Java with a deep focus on **Class and Object**, along with hands-on practice using **Eclipse IDE** and understanding **Git branching**.

#### Java OOPs – Class and Object
- Learned the concept of **Class** as a blueprint that defines attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
- Understood that a class does not consume memory until an object is created.
- Studied **Object** as an instance of a class representing a real-world entity.
- Understood:
  - State (attributes)
  - Behavior (methods)
  - Memory allocation in heap during object creation
- Practiced defining:
  - Attributes
  - Methods
  - Constructors (parameterized)
- Compared **Class vs Object** with real-world examples.


#### Programming Practice
- Implemented **Student Details program** using class, object, constructor, and methods.
- Implemented **Travel Details program** to understand real-world data modeling using classes and objects.
- Focused on proper object creation and method invocation.

#### Eclipse IDE (Deep Understanding)
- Explored Eclipse IDE interface and project structure
- Created Java projects and packages
- Understood:
  - Class creation
  - Running Java programs
  - Console output
  - Debugging basics
- Improved productivity using Eclipse shortcuts and features

#### Git Branching
- Learned the concept of **Git branches** and their importance in version control
- Created and switched between branches
- Understood how branches help in:
  - Isolated development
  - Feature-based coding
  - Safe experimentation
- Practiced pushing changes to specific branches

### 🗓 Day 2 – Constructors & Access Modifiers  
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**

#### Learned core OOP concepts in Java:
- Constructors in Java
  - Default Constructor
  - Parameterized Constructor
  - Copy Constructor
- Constructor Overloading
- Access Modifiers:
  - public, protected, default, private
- Instance vs Class (static) variables and methods

#### Implemented practical examples:
- Implemented a **Coffee Shop Order System** using different constructors
- Created a **School** class to demonstrate static variables and methods

#### Improved understanding of:
- Object initialization
- Data encapsulation
- Code structure and reusability

Committed and pushed all changes successfully.

### Day 3 – Java OOP Keywords & `instanceof` operator Content  
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

#### Learned important Java OOP features:
- `this` keyword  
- `final` keyword  
- `instanceof` operator  
- `static` keyword  

#### Key Understanding
- `this` refers to the current object and helps resolve variable conflicts
- `final` restricts modification, inheritance, or overriding
- `instanceof` is used to check object type at runtime
- `static` creates class-level shared members

#### Improved understanding of:
- Object-oriented design
- Class vs object behavior
- Code safety and reusability

Practiced all concepts in **java-oops-practice** branch.

### 🗓 Day 4 – Object Relationships & Class vs Object  
**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**  

Learned core concepts of **Object Modeling** and **object communication** in Java.

#### Topics Covered:
- Classes vs Objects (definition, purpose, memory allocation)
- Object relationships:
  - Aggregation
  - Association
  - Composition
- UML basics:
  - Class Diagrams
  - Object Diagrams
  - Sequence Diagrams

#### Problems Solved: (Examples):
- 📚 **Library and Books (Aggregation)**  
  Library contains multiple books, while books exist independently.

- 🏦 **Bank and Account Holders (Association)**  
  Modeled customer–bank relationships with object communication.

### 🗓 Day 5 – Java Inheritance & OOPS Hierarchies
**(Date: 31-Dec-2025)** 

#### 🔹 Java OOPS Practice (`java-oops-practice`)
Learned Inheritance in Java and its role in OOPS.

**Topics Covered:**
- Practiced Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical & Hybrid Inheritance
- Implemented method overriding, super() constructor calls, and polymorphism
- Understood access modifiers and their behavior in inheritance
- Modeled real-world hierarchies (Animal, Employee, Vehicle, Bank, Restaurant)
