### 📅 Week 2: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

---

### 🗓 Day 1 – OOPs Fundamentals (Class & Object), Eclipse IDE & Git Branching  
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**

Started learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts in Java with a deep focus on **Class and Object**, along with hands-on practice using **Eclipse IDE** and understanding **Git branching**.

#### Java OOPs – Class and Object
- Learned the concept of **Class** as a blueprint that defines attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
- Understood that a class does not consume memory until an object is created.
- Studied **Object** as an instance of a class representing a real-world entity.
- Understood:
  - State (attributes)
  - Behavior (methods)
  - Memory allocation in heap during object creation
- Practiced defining:
  - Attributes
  - Methods
  - Constructors (parameterized)
- Compared **Class vs Object** with real-world examples.

#### Key Concepts Covered
- Attributes (fields) and their role in defining object state
- Methods to define object behavior
- Constructors for object initialization
- Usage of `this` keyword
- Java naming conventions and best practices
- Importance of encapsulation and clean code structure

#### Programming Practice
- Implemented **Student Details program** using class, object, constructor, and methods.
- Implemented **Travel Details program** to understand real-world data modeling using classes and objects.
- Focused on proper object creation and method invocation.

#### Eclipse IDE (Deep Understanding)
- Explored Eclipse IDE interface and project structure
- Created Java projects and packages
- Understood:
  - Class creation
  - Running Java programs
  - Console output
  - Debugging basics
- Improved productivity using Eclipse shortcuts and features

#### Git Branching
- Learned the concept of **Git branches** and their importance in version control
- Created and switched between branches
- Understood how branches help in:
  - Isolated development
  - Feature-based coding
  - Safe experimentation
- Practiced pushing changes to specific branches

#### Summary
- Strengthened foundation of Java OOPs using Class and Object
- Gained practical experience with Eclipse IDE
- Improved understanding of Git branching and workflow
- Maintained clean folder structure and committed changes properly
