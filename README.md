### 📅 Week 2: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

---

### 🗓 Day 9 – OOPs Fundamentals (Class & Object), Eclipse IDE & Git Branching  
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**

Started learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts in Java with a deep focus on **Class and Object**, along with hands-on practice using **Eclipse IDE** and understanding **Git branching**.

#### Java OOPs – Class and Object
- Learned the concept of **Class** as a blueprint that defines attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
- Understood that a class does not consume memory until an object is created.
- Studied **Object** as an instance of a class representing a real-world entity.
- Understood:
  - State (attributes)
  - Behavior (methods)
  - Memory allocation in heap during object creation
- Practiced defining:
  - Attributes
  - Methods
  - Constructors (parameterized)
- Compared **Class vs Object** with real-world examples.

#### Programming Practice
- Implemented **Student Details program** using class, object, constructor, and methods.
- Implemented **Travel Details program** to understand real-world data modeling using classes and objects.
- Focused on proper object creation and method invocation.

#### Eclipse IDE (Deep Understanding)
- Explored Eclipse IDE interface and project structure
- Created Java projects and packages
- Understood:
  - Class creation
  - Running Java programs
  - Console output
  - Debugging basics
- Improved productivity using Eclipse shortcuts and features

#### Git Branching
- Learned the concept of **Git branches** and their importance in version control
- Created and switched between branches
- Understood how branches help in:
  - Isolated development
  - Feature-based coding
  - Safe experimentation
- Practiced pushing changes to specific branches

### 🗓 Day 10 – Constructors & Access Modifiers  
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**

#### Learned core OOP concepts in Java:
- Constructors in Java
  - Default Constructor
  - Parameterized Constructor
  - Copy Constructor
- Constructor Overloading
- Access Modifiers:
  - public, protected, default, private
- Instance vs Class (static) variables and methods

#### Implemented practical examples:
- Implemented a **Coffee Shop Order System** using different constructors
- Created a **School** class to demonstrate static variables and methods

#### Improved understanding of:
- Object initialization
- Data encapsulation
- Code structure and reusability

Committed and pushed all changes successfully.

### Day 11 – Java OOP Keywords, instanceof Operator & Scenario-Based Practice  
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

#### Java OOP Concepts (java-oops-practice)
Learned key Java features:
- `this` keyword – refers to the current object
- `final` keyword – restricts modification or inheritance
- `instanceof` operator – checks object type at runtime
- `static` keyword – creates class-level shared members

Improved understanding of scope, object behavior, and code reusability.

#### Scenario-Based Programs (core-java-practice)
Solved real-world problems:
- Shopkeeper’s Discount Dashboard (for-loop, if-else)
- School Bus Attendance System (for-each loop, counters)
- Phone Recharge Simulator (switch case, loops, balance tracking)

Practiced logical thinking and control flow using real-life scenarios.
